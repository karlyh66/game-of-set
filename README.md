# The Game of Set

Set is a matching card game designed by Marsha Falco in 1974. The basis of the game is creating sets: groups of 3 cards that all either have the same or entirely different shapes, color, fill pattern, and number. This project was created as the APCS 2017 - 2018 final project. ![Learn more about set.] (https://norvig.com/SET.html)
